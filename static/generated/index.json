    "prompt": "A small group of diverse international students, including both boys and girls, collaborate energetically on a creative project in a sunlit, modern learning space. An approachable teacher offers guidance from the side, joining the discussion rather than leading it. The students are positioned as active directors, gesturing and sketching ideas with analog tools and physical prototypes on the table. The environment features natural wood, glass, and touches of deep indigo and orange in decor and clothing, with plants softening the space. The composition uses asymmetric balance, with layered depth—students in focus, others collaborating in the background, and generous negative space that suggests possibility. Warm, golden-hour natural light streams through large windows, revealing a glimpse of Vienna’s cityscape beyond. The mood is one of confident curiosity and engaged teamwork, with no screens, tech devices, or written text visible anywhere.",
